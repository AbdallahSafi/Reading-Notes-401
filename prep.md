# Solving Problems

A simple set of steps
I am going to give you a simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.
As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.

# Act like you make $1000/hr

- The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth.
- See, many people could be making a fortune (if they used their time well)…but instead, they give away their time in unproductive ways that leave them broke, unhappy, and stuck.
But what if you placed a high value on your time?

- “The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”

- For world-class performers, busyness and stress are the enemy. They’re a sign you’re off-track. It means you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters.

- “People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.”


# How to think like a programmer

- Essentially, it’s all about a more effective way for problem solving.

- Bad way to “solve” problems:
1. Try a solution.
2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

- The best way involves a) having a framework and b) practicing it.

`“The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.” — V. Anton Spraul`

### what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

1. Understand

How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.


2. Plan

- Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

To get a good plan, answer this question:

“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”


3. Divide

- Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.

- Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

4. Stuck?

- Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).

- Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).

- Caveat: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.


# The 5 Whys

- The method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.

- You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.
